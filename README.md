# The RECAST API

This is the  code for the RECAST RESTful API currently hosted at 
http://recast.perimeterinstitute.ca

As RECAST is a community project, we are moving to GitHub for collaborative development.
RECAST packages (eg. API wrappers, back-end implementations etc.) should be in repositories named recast-\<package\>
